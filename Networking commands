NETWORKING COMMANDS:

tcpdump 

tcpdump is a most powerful and widely used command-line packets sniffer or package 
analyzer tool which is used to capture or filter TCP/IP packets that received or transferred over a 
network on a specific interface for analysis. 

netstat 

Displays active TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet 
statistics, IP routing table, IPv4 statistics and IPv6 statistics. It indicates state of a TCP connection. 
it's a helpful tool in finding problems and determining the amount of traffic on the network as a 
performance measurement.

ifconfig / ipconfig 

Displays basic current TCP/IP network configuration. It is very useful to troubleshoot 
networking problems. ipconfig/all is used to provide detailed information such as IP address, subnet 
mask, MAC address, DNS server, DHCP server, default gateway etc. ipconfig/renew is used to 
renew a DHCP assigned IP address whereas ipconfig/release is used to discard the assigned DHCP 
IP address. 

nslookup 

It provides a command-line utility for querying DNS table of a DNS Server. It returns IP 
address for the given host name. 

traceroute / tracert

Displays the path taken to a destination by sending ICMP Echo Request messages to the 
destination with TTL field values. The path displayed is the list of nearest router interfaces taken 
along each hop in the path between source host and destination. 

ping

Verifies IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet Control 
Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages. The receipt of corresponding Echo Reply 
messages are displayed, along with round-trip times. Ping is the primary TCP/IP command used to 
troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, and name resolution.
